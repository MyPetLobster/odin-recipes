        The perfect hardboiled eggs are surprisingly easy to make. Simply fill a pot with water, then add the 
        uncooked eggs BEFORE you even turn the heat on. Then turn the heat on high and wait for the water to 
        reach a boil. Once the water is boiling, turn off the heat and put a lid on the pot. Keep the pot on
        the same heating element. <strong><em>Set a time for 18 minutes.</em></strong> After 18 minutes, put the eggs into a bowl of 
        ice water. There you have it!
