After completing the assignment, here are the things I learned and put to use:

    3. The difference between absolute and relative paths for the href attribute

       I wanted to add a little info below each link.
    5. I learned about headings (h1, h2, etc) and the basic structure of html files.
    6. How to organize the files in my project folder and how to use the command
       line to navigate.
